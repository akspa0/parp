# WarcraftAnalyzer

WarcraftAnalyzer is a C# project that extends the functionality of Warcraft.NET to create a comprehensive analysis tool for World of Warcraft data files, specifically ADT and PM4/PD4 files.

## Project Overview

This project aims to port existing Python code for analyzing World of Warcraft data files to C#, leveraging the Warcraft.NET library. The main objectives are:

1. Implement file parsers for ADT, PM4, and PD4 files
2. Extend Warcraft.NET with additional chunk decoders as needed
3. Develop an analysis tool for examining file contents
4. Create a user-friendly interface for file selection and analysis
