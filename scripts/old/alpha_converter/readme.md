This is intended to take our finished adts and down-convert them to WoW 0.5.3 versioned alpha maps.

It does not work... yet.

It's chatGPT written, with info taken from Mjollna's gillijimproject, and the wow.dev wiki.
It technically should work, with a little more work. It's just not understanding what a WDT's purpose is, or how to construct an ADT properly.
It handles manipulation of some chunks and attempts to sorta rebuild appropriate adt's or wdt's, depending on which direction you're trying to go.

It's being tested with the decompressed mpq's from 0.5.3 alpha world map files, as adding mpq reading added more complexity and caused issues with getting even as far as this has gotten so far.
It needs an actual programmer to finesse the data properly.
