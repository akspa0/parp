3dM63 is the final version that works properly
3dM63-flipz is a flipped Z axis version that may correct some mesh issues.

make sure to feed the script a clean directory of minimap tiles with XX_YY coordinates in the filenames. The script will handle the rest.

downsampling might be necessary to get a smooth mesh, but will cut the input image resolution in half. 

In the future, the hope is that the output will be in glTF format, thus enabling viewing in a web browser without much hassle.
